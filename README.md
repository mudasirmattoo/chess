Overview:
Advanced Chess-like Game is a web-based turn-based strategy game inspired by chess. The game is developed using Django for the backend and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. It features a grid-based board with unique character types, each with distinct movement and capture abilities.

Features:

Character Types:
Pawn: Moves one block in any direction (Left, Right, Forward, Backward).
Hero1: Moves two blocks straight in any direction and captures opponents in its path.
Hero2: Moves two blocks diagonally and captures opponents in its path.

Gameplay:
Players take turns to move their characters on the board.
Characters can capture opponents if they land on a square occupied by an opposing piece.
The game ends when one player eliminates all of the opponentâ€™s pieces.
